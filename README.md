Car Viewer AR project, an application developed for viewing car models in AR!

## INSTALLATION
- Download the latest release

## HOW TO USE
- Hit “Start” to step into the magical world of AR and fire up your camera view. Make sure you’ve got enough space around you, otherwise the app might throw a little tantrum!
- Tap the "Car Icon" to scan the space around you and see a cool preview of a vehicle. When the preview turns green, just point your device and tap to place the car right where you want it.
- Turn on "Moveable" to swipe and slide the car around, or turn off "Moveable" to tweak its height, rotation, and size with a simple tap on the car.
- Tap the little “i icons" on the car for fun facts about the model.
- Use the "Trash Icon" to clear the scene and the "Car Icon" to add another!
